HW4: 
I explored a dataset about student performance, examining how factors like study time, anxiety levels, and exam scores are connected. I learned a lot about identifying these connections and realized the importance of choosing the right variables when building models, so they donâ€™t become too complex and ineffective. Although I worked on the assignment independently, I focused on analyzing the scatter matrix and explaining the relationships between variables, which helped me engage more with the analysis and reflect on my progress in the course.
