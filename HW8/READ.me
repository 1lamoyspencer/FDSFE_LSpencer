I learned how to identify overfitting in machine learning models by comparing training and validation losses. I worked on training a model, implementing early stopping. I also wrote  code to monitor and compare training and validation losses, which helped me detect overfitting early on. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring early stopping triggered at the right time, as the model still overfitted despite its implementation. Through this process, I gained insights into model behaviour and how to mitigate overfitting. I worked alone, learning from online resources, machine learning documentation, and my own experimentation.
