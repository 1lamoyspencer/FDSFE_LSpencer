What was the homework about?
The homework was all about analyzing a customer personality dataset using machine learning. I had to cluster the data with DBSCAN and then use t-SNE to reduce the dimensions and visualize the results.

What did you learn?
I learned how to clean and prep data, apply DBSCAN for clustering, and use t-SNE to make the data easier to understand. Plus, I got to visualize everything with some cool plots.

Who did you work with? What did you contribute specifically to the group work?
I worked on the project by myself, so I took care of everything â€“ from getting the data and prepping it to analyzing it and creating the visualizations.
